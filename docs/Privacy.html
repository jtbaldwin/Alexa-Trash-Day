<title>Trash Day Privacy Policy</title>

<b>Effective: January 1, 2017</b>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Trash Day skill (hereafter, "application") is a simple reminder service to
help users remember a list of weekly pickups and query when the next pickups occur.  To
perform this service, the application gathers and uses information from
each user in order to perform its function.

<p>This document describes the information collected, how it is used, and the storage of 
that information.  Any user that does not wish their information to be used in this way is 
provided <a href="#RemovingYourInfo">instructions</a> on how to remove their information and discontinue use of the 
application.

<p>This information is used only to provide this application's service. The information is 
not shared or sold with any other party.  Use of this software your 
consent to the collection, use, transfer, and storage of the any user 
information given to the application, as well as the terms of the application's 
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/trash-day-docs/TermsOfService.html">Terms of Service</a>.

<h1>Information Collected</h1>

<p>The application collects the following information from the Alexa service (user id and 
log data) as well as verbally from the user (pickup schedule, time zone and log data).

<h2>Alexa User Id</h2>

<p>When a user enables the Trash Day skill, a single userId is generated for all requests
that will be sent by that user.  The application has no way to map this userId back
to a specific Amazon Echo device or user account.  The application knows that this
userId applies to a unique user account, but has no knowledge of the owner of that user
account or the location of that user in the world.

<h2>Pickup Schedule</h2>
<p>The application verbally collects weekly pickup times for whatever items the user wants to
track.  For example, a user's "trash" pickup may occur on "Monday 7am" and "Thursday 7am."
and their "recycling" pickup may occur on "Wednesday at Noon."

<h2>Time Zone</h2>
<p>The application needs to know the user's time zone in order to compute when the
next pickups will occur.  Since the Alexa service does not provide this information
to 3rd-party skills like Trash Day, the application requires each user to verbally
set the appropriate time zone.

<h2>Log Data</h2>
<p>As part of normal operation, the application generates logs of user activity.  This
is used to monitor the application for correct functioning and diagnose any problems
that may occur.

<h1>Information Usage</h1>

<p>The information is used in two ways.  First, the user ID, user's Zip Code and Pickup Schedule
are necessary to provide the application functions as a pickup reminder service for
specific users.  Second, log data is used for the operation and maintenance of the
application itself.

<p>All information collected is stored in Amazon's Dynamo DB and CloudWatch services.
A single Dynamo DB table item exists for each userId and stores the 
user's associated time zone and pickup schedule information.  The log data is stored
in Amazon's CloudWatch service.

<p>The application uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect 
your information.  It secures your user data by relying on the security components within the
several Amazon services (Dynamo DB, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, Identity and Access Management).  

<h1 id="RemovingYourInfo">Removing Your Information</h1>

<p>Any application user may delete all of their data using the command: <strong>"Alexa, tell Trash Day, to
delete entire schedule"</strong>.  After deleting their data, a user should 
disable the Trash Day skill using the command: <strong>"Alexa, disable theTrash Day skill"</strong>.

<h1>Children Under 13</h1>

<p>This application is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that a child
under 13 has provided us with personal information without consent, please use the
instructions under the <a href="#RemovingYourInfo">Removing Your Information</a> section to remove that 
information.

<h1>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This policy may be revised in the future.  If so, changes will be posted to this page.
 If you continue to use the application after those changes are in effect, you agree to 
 the revised policy.
