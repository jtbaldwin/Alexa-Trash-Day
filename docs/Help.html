<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Thank you for being a Trash Day user.  Since the Alexa service only provides
voice and (small) cards to provide help for using the application, I have created
this document for users that may need additional information.
<p>
<strong>Updated 2017-02-12</strong>: Trash Day now supports weekly, biweekly, and monthly pickups!
Thanks to the users who took the time to read this document and email their request.
I hope this change makes the skill more useful to a lot of people.

<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>
To use Trash Day, you have to tell the application your time zone and make a 
pickup schedule.  This is the most difficult part of using the Trash Day
application.  As an example, here's how I setup to use the application in
my house:
<ul>
<li>Alexa, tell Trash Day, to change schedule.
<li>Set time zone to Eastern.
<li>Add weekly trash pickup on Tuesday at seven-thirty A.M.
<li>Add weekly trash pickup on Friday at seven-thirty A.M.
<li>Add biweekly recycling pickup on this Wednesday at four P.M.
<li>Add biweekly lawn waste pickup on Wednesday after next at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly scrap metal pickup on the fifteenth at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly scrap metal pickup on the last day of the month at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly rent pickup five days before the end of the month at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly hockey team pickup on the first Saturday of the month at nine A.M.
<li>Add monthly hockey team pickup on the third Saturday of the month at nine A.M.
<li>Add monthly little league pickup on the last Saturday of the month at ten A.M.
<li>Tell me the schedule.
<li>Stop.
</ul>
<B>NOTE:</B>The Trash Day application keeps listening (the blue ring is lit on the Echo)
while you give commands.  If you mess up or get delayed, the blue ring will turn off.
If that happens, just say "Alexa, tell Trash Day, to change schedule" and continue where you left
off with your setup.

<h1>Usage</h1>    	
<p>
Once you have setup your time zone and pickup schedule, using Trash Day is easy.  Here
are the common commands:
<ul>
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, what's next?
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, is it trash day?
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, when is the next recycling pickup?
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, what is the schedule?
</ul>

<h1>Schedule Updates</h1>
<p>
If you need to make changes to your pickup schedule, use commands like the following
to set your time zone, delete old pickups, and add new pickups.  You can use any combination
of these commands, depending on what you need for your schedule.
<ul>
<li>Alexa, open Trash Day.
<li>Set time zone to Pacific.
<li>Add weekly trash pickup on Tuesday at seven-thirty A.M.
<li>Add weekly trash pickup on Friday at seven-thirty A.M.
<li>Add biweekly recycling pickup on this Wednesday at four P.M.
<li>Add biweekly lawn waste pickup on Wednesday after next at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly scrap metal pickup on the fifteenth at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly scrap metal pickup on the last day of the month at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly rent pickup five days before the end of the month at four P.M.
<li>Add monthly hockey team pickup on the first Saturday of the month at nine A.M.
<li>Add monthly hockey team pickup on the third Saturday of the month at nine A.M.
<li>Add monthly little league pickup on the last Saturday of the month at ten A.M.
<li>Delete all lawn waste pickups.
<li>Delete weekly trash pickup on Tuesday at seven-thirty A.M.
<li>Delete weekly trash pickup on Friday at seven-thirty A.M.
<li>Delete biweekly recycling pickup on this Wednesday at four P.M.
<li>Delete biweekly lawn waste pickup on Wednesday after next at four P.M.
<li>Delete monthly scrap metal pickup on the fifteenth at four P.M.
<li>Delete monthly scrap metal pickup on the last day of the month at four P.M.
<li>Delete monthly rent pickup five days before the end of the month at four P.M.
<li>Delete monthly hockey team pickup on the first Saturday of the month at nine A.M.
<li>Delete monthly hockey team pickup on the third Saturday of the month at nine A.M.
<li>Delete monthly little league pickup on the last Saturday of the month at ten A.M.
<li>Tell me the schedule.
<li>Stop.
</ul>
<p>
If you need to make more extensive changes, you may want to delete the entire
schedule.  To do this:
<ul>
<li>Alexa, tell Trash Day, to delete the entire schedule.
<li>Yes
</ul>
You will need to answer "Yes" to confirm the schedule deletion.  Once the schedule
is deleted, rebuild a new schedule by using the commands given in the Setup section 
at the top of this page.
