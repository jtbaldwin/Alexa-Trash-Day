<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Thank you for being a Trash Day user.  Since the Alexa service only provides
voice and (small) cards to provide help for using the application, I have created
this document for users that may need additional information.

<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>
To use Trash Day, you have to tell the application your time zone and make a 
pickup schedule.  This is the most difficult part of using the Trash Day
application.  As an example, here's how I setup to use the application in
my house:
<ul>
<li>Alexa, open Trash Day
<li>Set time zone to Eastern.
<li>Add trash pickup on Tuesday at seven-thirty am.
<li>Add trash pickup on Friday at seven-thirty am.
<li>Add recycling pickup on Friday at seven-thirty am.
<li>Add lawn waste pickup on Wednesday at one p.m.
<li>Tell me the schedule.
<li>Stop.
</ul>
<B>NOTE:</B>The Trash Day application keeps listening (the blue ring is lit on the Echo)
while you give commands.  If you mess up or get delayed, the blue ring will turn off.
If that happens, just say "Alexa, open Trash Day" and continue where you left
off with your setup.

<h1>Usage</h1>    	
<p>
Once you have setup your time zone and pickup schedule, using Trash Day is easy.  Here
are the common commands:
<ul>
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, what's next?
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, is it recycling day?
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, when is the next trash pickup?
<li>Alexa, ask Trash Day, what is the schedule?
</ul>

<h1>Schedule Updates</h1>
<p>
If you need to make changes to your pickup schedule, use commands like the following
to set your time zone, add new weekly pickups, and delete old pickups.
<ul>
<li>Alexa, open Trash Day.
<li>Set time zone to Pacific.
<li>Add recycling pickup on Friday at seven-thirty am.
<li>Add recycling pickup on Wednesday at one p.m.
<li>Delete all lawn waste pickups.
<li>Tell me the schedule.
<li>Stop.
</ul>
<p>
If you need to make more extensive changes, you may want to delete the entire
schedule.  To do this:
<ul>
<li>Alexa, open Trash Day.
<li>Delete the entire schedule.
<li>Yes
</ul>
You will need to answer "Yes" to confirm the schedule deletion.  Once the schedule
is deleted, rebuild a new schedule by using the commands given in the Setup section 
at the top of this page.
